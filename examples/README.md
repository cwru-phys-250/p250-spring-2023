# Examples

Contained here are the examples used throughout the semester.
The examples will be updated weekly.

You should download these notebooks and explore them yourself!

A brief description of each example follows.

- **Numbers_and_Precision.ipynb**:
This shows the main difficulty with numerical work -- finite precision!
- **Algorithm_Choice.ipynb**:
An example showing that all mathematically equivalent algorithms do not behave the same way numerically.
- **Animated_Root_Finding.ipynb**:
Animated examples of (simple) implemenations of some root finding algorithms. Requires ipywidgets to run.
- **Root_Finding.ipynb**:
An example showing the use of routines from `scipy.optimize` for one dimensional root finding.
- **Interpolation.ipynb**:
An example showing the use of routines from `scipy.interpolate` for one dimensional interpolation.
- **Numerical_Derivatives.ipynb**:
An examples describing Richardson extrapolation as applied to center differencing and some examples of its use.
- **Numerical_Integration.ipynb**:
An example using numerical integration to show in a simple model why incandescent light bulbs have been relegated to the dustbin of history.
- **ODE.ipynb**:
Revisiting the simple pendulum, now as an ODE solved using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` and some issues related to its use.
- **Stellar_Mass.ipynb**:
Example of problem solving which reviews many things we have learned. Here we analyze how to calculate the mass of a star from tabulated data. This implements the analytic work performed in class.
- **Arrays_Vectors.ipynb**:
An introduction to linear algebra but with a focus more on how we represent vectors in NumPy using arrays.  There are important differences between vectors (and matrices) and arrays. We also briefly discuss the Newton-Raphson method.
- **Linear_Equations.ipynb**:
An introduction to solving systems of linear equations using functions from scipy.
- **Eigenvalues.ipynb**:
Eigenvalue problem are prevalent in many branches of physics. In classical mechanics they aid in finding the principle axes of rotating bodies and in finding the normal modes of oscillating systems. In quantum mechanics the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation **is** an eigenvalue problem! Here we get a little practice using functions from `scipy.linalg` for solving these types of problems.
- **Curve_Fitting.ipynb**:
Parameter estimation from the least squares fitting of data to a model is a standard way in which theories are compared to experiments. Here we study some of the basics of using the chi squared for such a purpose.
- **Random.ipynb**:
An introduction to random numbers. Examples include the transformation method and Monte Carlo integration.
