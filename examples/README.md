# Examples

Contained here are the examples used throughout the semester.
The examples will be updated weekly.

You should download these notebooks and explore them yourself!

A brief description of each example follows.

- **Numbers_and_Precision.ipynb**:
This shows the main difficulty with numerical work -- finite precision!
- **Algorithm_Choice.ipynb**:
An example showing that all mathematically equivalent algorithms do not behave the same way numerically.
- **Animated_Root_Finding.ipynb**:
Animated examples of (simple) implemenations of some root finding algorithms. Requires ipywidgets to run.
- **Root_Finding.ipynb**:
An example showing the use of routines from `scipy.optimize` for one dimensional root finding.
- **Interpolation.ipynb**:
An example showing the use of routines from `scipy.interpolate` for one dimensional interpolation.
- **Numerical_Derivatives.ipynb**:
An examples describing Richardson extrapolation as applied to center differencing and some examples of its use.
- **Numerical_Integration.ipynb**:
An example using numerical integration to show in a simple model why incandescent light bulbs have been relegated to the dustbin of history.
- **ODE.ipynb**:
Revisiting the simple pendulum, now as an ODE solved using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` and some issues related to its use.
- **Stellar_Mass.ipynb**:
Example of problem solving which reviews many things we have learned. Here we analyze how to calculate the mass of a star from tabulated data. This implements the analytic work performed in class.
- **Arrays_Vectors.ipynb**:
An introduction to linear algebra but with a focus more on how we represent vectors in NumPy using arrays.  There are important differences between vectors (and matrices) and arrays. We also briefly discuss the Newton-Raphson method.
