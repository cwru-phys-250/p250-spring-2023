The final prelab notebook will not be held to the same level of completeness as we require for labs.  Even if you get stuck/confused on things you should put in effort to try to understand the important points, and then move on to other parts of the prelab.  If you cannot complete a portion of the prelab then you should say what you have done, what is confusing, *etc.*  In other words, give some indication of how far you got.  This can be done by describing in words what you are thinking."

    "We have already used the notebook a bit, but there is a lot to it and a lot of ways to use it.  Fortunately there are also a lot of ways to learn about using it.  We have discussed some of these: searching the web for information, within the Jupyter Lab interface itself there are a few places to look, and using the `Help` tab in the menu bar.  Yet another way to see what is available is through the `Command Palette` which can be activated from the `View` menu.  This contains a list of all the commands that you can use in any context along with any keyboard shortcuts that are defined by default.  We will be using the notebook, so any commands associated with it will be of interest to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worthwhile to get used to using keyboard shortcuts.  Though everything can be done by pointing and clicking your way through the interface, the keyboard shortcuts make things much faster and more pleasant.  It is good to start learning and using them early."

    "## Good Coding Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in Lab00, we should always explicitly load the modules we wish to use.  Further, we should do this is a way that does not \"pollute the namespace\".  We will always do that in this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "As one example of why this is important consider the cosine function.  In standard Python the cosine function is *not defined*.  Instead we need to load it from somewhere.  There are at least three places would could get it from:\n",
    "1. Python `math` module: This only operates on single numbers. In our work we will usually want our functions to work on arrays.\n",
    "2. The `numpy` module: This is the one we want to use and the one that gets loaded automatically in various circumstances.\n",
    "3. The `sympy` module: This would be the one we wanted if we were doing symbolic manipulations (sadly we will not be doing so this semester).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to load all the functions in each of these modules into the default name space and tried to just call the `cos` function which one do we get?  It will depend on which one was loaded *most recently*!  Since we do not want the behavior of our code to depend on the load order of modules or the state of our kernel we should explicitly load the module we want and use the function from that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boiler Plate\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of all of our documents we should load all the modules we want to use.  This will become standard practice in labs from now on.  One thing we will always want is the `numpy` module.  It can be loaded as\n",
    "> `import numpy as np`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` command loads a module for us.  It creates a namespace with the same name as the module.  Thus to access anything defined in the module we would need to prepend it with `numpy.` (notice there is a 'dot' after the `numpy`).  For example, to access the cosine function we would use `numpy.cos`.  This is a lot of typing.  Fortunately we can give it a shorter name (an alias), which is what the `as` phrase does for us.  Here we have renamed `numpy` to be `np` so that we can access the cosine function as `np.cos`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we can name our modules anything we want when we import them, there are some standard conventions that have evolved over the years.  It is best to use the standard conventions whenever possible.  Calling the `numpy` module `np` is quite standard, you will find it in almost any modern example online and is what you should always use."
