    "\n",
    "We have been warned many times to avoid writing loops in `python`, as they can be slow and prone to coding errors. We have seen a few features of `NumPy` that allow us to avoid writing loops: functions work on arrays of values and array slicing allows us to view an array in many ways without having to create a new array. We will continue to learn about these features along with a few other ones. Often we write loops to perform mathematical operations. In languages that include vector processing capabilities, provided in `python` through the `NumPy` module, there is almost always a function that can be used to perform the calculation without the need to write such a loop. The price we pay for this is that we must be able to store all of the information needed for the calculation in arrays. In other words, the trade off is between memory usage and computation speed: with little memory usage we can write a loop which will be slow, with a lot of memory usage we can perform the calculation \"all at once\" using a built-in function which is often significantly faster than the loop."

It was written over 40 years ago by Donald Knuth in response to electronic proofs of a book he had written.  At the time, publishers were switching from hand typesetting to electronic typesetting of documents.  The proofs were so poorly typeset that he wrote his own system.  This includes tools for creating fonts and a complete set of fonts with all the needed mathematical symbols (something nonexistent at the time and only recently can you find complete sets of fonts which include mathematical symbols). You should also be familiar with Donald Knuth. He is arguably the greatest computer scientist ever, has/is writing the quintessential books on computer science, *The Art of Computer Programming*, and is a graduate of the Case Institute of Technology. Yes, he wandered these same halls in Rockefeller over 50 years ago.\n",
