Just as we saw with ordinary differential equations, there are many details with finding a good algorithm for solving a partial differential equation. Issues such as stability, convergence, step sizes, *etc.* must be considered for each type of partial differential equation we wish to solve. In this case we will use the *Crank-Nicolson* method.

Also, the matrices $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{B}$ can be written in terms of known quantities. Thus, if we know the temperatures at time, $t_j$, then the right hand side of the equation, $\\vec\\tau_j$, is also known so that we can determine $\\vec T_{j+1}$ by just solving the linear system of equations as we have discussed in class!\n",

(In the lab these points will be equally spaced, however, it is best to derive results in a generic manner and specialize when needed.) Starting from the initial conditions means starting from the initial time step, $j=0$, so that the right hand side of our system of equations is known. With this, write out the complete **system of linear equations**. Do this for yourself on your scratch paper, we will use these results shortly. You should see some patterns in the equations which we will exploit to more efficiently solve them. In doing this you should find you need quantities like $T(t,x_{-1})$ and $T(t,x_{N+1})$. In principle the values of these will depend on our choice of boundary conditions. Here we will just set them equal to zero."
