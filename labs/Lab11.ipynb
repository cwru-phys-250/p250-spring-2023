    "You have been warned to never write your own random number generator. For a long time it has been recognized that the generation of random numbers by computers is a necessary feature, so system libraries provided with computers have contained functions for generating them. Unfortunately this was not considered to be very important so these functions were not carefully created. As an example we will consider the function `randu` which, many years ago, was provided on IBM mainframes in their system library. Who knows how many people used this for what were suppose to be real simulations! See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANDU) for an interesting, humorous, and disturbing discussion of this random number generator. This is but one example. It is because of these bad implementations that many people will still never use a random number generator provided in a system library. More recently, due to the reliance on cryptography, quality random numbers have become very important, so very good, well tested random number generators are now commonly available. Even so, `randu` remains as **the example** of how bad random number generators can be.\n",

    "This is a perfectly good algorithm as long as $a$, $c$, and $m$ are chosen well. The choices made in the library were $m=2^{31}$, $a=65539$, and $c=0$ because the calculations could be implemented very efficiently, an important criterion at that time. This is implemented as a Python class below. You should run this cell."

To see this we want to arrange the random numbers we generated into triplets. The easiest way to do this is to turn the 1 dimensional array into a 2 dimensional one with 3 columns. This is trivial to do using `reshape` to, not surprisingly, reshape the array. In fact, we want 3 columns and as many rows as required to use all the values. Fortunately `reshape` can determine the number of row required for us! Using `br = br.reshape((-1, 3))` does exactly what we want.

    "## Ising Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know to be careful when generating random numbers we can use them for Monte Carlo simulations of systems. One example comes from the study of the Ising model. The Ising model provides a simple way of examining how magnetic systems behave - in particular ferromagnets - as well as other systems described by the same mathematics (such as some fluids or gasses). The basic idea is to model the behavior of the system as spins on a lattice where each spin can interact with its nearest neighboring spins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will work with such a lattice in two dimensions. The lattice in this case is simply a grid, or matrix, containing values of either +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down). The lattice is represented symbolically using the variable $\\sigma(i,j)$, where $i$ and $j$ label coordinates on the lattice (or equivalently, matrix components).\n",
    "\n",
    "Physically, such systems prefer to have adjacent spins aligned. This can be achieved by defining an energy function which is minimized when nearby spins have the same value. This principle of minimizing the energy is commonly applied to other physical systems and is a prevalent idea in physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our simple model here the energy of the system will thus be determined by the coupling of a spin with its nearest neighbors. We can go a step further and also model the lattice of spins in the presence of an external magnetic field represented by the parameter $\\mu$. A spin in a magnetic field prefers to align with the direction of magnetic field; the misalignment of the spin and the magnetic field will come at the cost of higher energy in the system. Putting these ideas together the energy of the system can be written as\n",
    "$$ E = -J\\sum_{i,j}\\sigma(i, j)\\left[\\sigma(i+1, j) + \\sigma(i-1, j) + \\sigma(i, j+1) + \\sigma(i,j-1)\\right] - \\mu \\sum_{i,j} \\sigma(i,j), $$\n",
    "where $J \\geq 0$ is the strength of interactions between spins (so for larger values of $J$, the more the spins will prefer to be aligned). Note that the energy will be lowest (most negative) when all spins have the same value and the same sign as $\\mu$. Also note that, because this energy function relies on computing values of adjacent spins we will need to decide how to handle spins on the boundary of the lattice. This will be discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure we will use to simulate this system is known as the \"Metropolis algorithm\". Given a starting lattice of spins, we choose a random point ($i$, $j$). Next we decide whether or not to flip the spin at this chosen point using the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If flipping the spin would result in a decrease in total energy of the system, $\\Delta E = E_\\curvearrowright - E_\\oslash < 0$, flip the spin.\n",
    "- If not, flip the spin with a probability $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\Delta E/T}$, where $T$ is the temperature of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $E_\\oslash$ represents the energy of the system when the spin is not flipped ($\\oslash$ representing \"not flipped\", this is the energy of the system before we apply the Metropolis algorithm) and $E_\\curvearrowright$ represents the energy the system will have if a spin is flipped (using the symbol $\\curvearrowright$ to represent \"flipped\"). The time evolution of the system is modeled by repeatedly applying the Metropolis algorithm to determine how the spins behave."

    "In the Metropolis algorithm we pick a random point and decide whether or not to flip the spin based on the change in energy. Thus we need to write a function to calculate $\\Delta E$ given a spin flip at a point ($i_f$, $j_f$), for some choice of integers $i_f, j_f \\in [0, N-1]$. At first glance this looks tedious; the energy defined above contains sums over the entire lattice. However, since we are only considering flipping a single spin, all of them will remain the same *except* at the point being flipped. This means that since we are interested in the *change in the energy*, not the total energy, most of the terms in the sum will cancel and $\\Delta E$ will be a much simpler expression than we may have feared. To see this, notice that if we flip the spin at $(i_f, j_f)$ the terms which *will not cancel* in the energy are given by\n",

To resolve this we employ periodic boundary conditions meaning that $\\sigma(-1,j_f) = \\sigma(N-1,j_f)$, $\\sigma(N,j_f) = \\sigma(0,j_f)$, $\\sigma(i_f,-1) = \\sigma(i_f,N-1)$, and $\\sigma(i_f,N) = \\sigma(i_f,0)$. One simple way to implement this is to use modular arithmetic on the index values which allows increasing numbers to \"wrap around\" in the way we need. In Python (and in many languages), the mod function is implemented using the `%` operator, so $a \\pmod b$ = `a % b`. If you are unfamiliar with modular arithmetic, the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic) should help you catch up. For our purposes, it will suffice to mod the index values of each spin in the lattice by $N$ after adding or subtracting `1` from them. You should verify that running `-1%N` will return `N-1`, and `N%N` will return `0`. (*Warning:* languages other than Python may behave differently when modding negative numbers! In some such languages `-1%N` is equal to `-1`. Since `N%N` is always `0` it is safe to add `N` to any expression before using modular arithmetic. In other words, it is always safe to write `(i-1+N)%N` and this will work in languages that treat negative numbers differently than Python.)"

As stated above, $\\mu$ represents an external magnetic field and can be used to study spins in such a setting, for example a magnet placed in an external magnetic field. We know that spins prefer to align with an external magnetic field. This means if $\\mu$ is positive then positive spins should be preferred. Explore different choices for $T$ and $\\mu$ and see how the system behaves. For example, we saw above that for $T=10$ the system remain fairly disordered. What happens if we include a non-zero $\\mu$ for this temperature?"
