    "In this lab we will solve a real problem which means we will encounter a number of side issues to distract us from our main task. We have already seen some of the issues in the prelab. Also, typically when doing calculations we want to avoid writing loops if we can help it since loops are cumbersome to write and slow to run. Array slicing is a powerful feature of `numpy` arrays that makes it possible to avoid writing loops in many cases. We will discuss array slicing in more detail in the future, for now we can use a simple form of it, as discussed below."

    "We wish to find the angular velocity of the Earth as a function of time as it orbits the Sun. This does not sound too hard but is more involved than we may first think. To make things a little simpler we will only find the angular speed of the Earth, $\\mathrm{d}\\theta/\\mathrm{d}t \\equiv \\dot{\\theta}(t)$, not its direction. From Kepler’s second law we know that the angular speed in an elliptical orbit is not constant: the radius of the orbit sweeps out equal area in equal time. When we study central forces in classical mechanics we learn that this can be understood in terms of conservation of angular momentum and further that we can easily write down equations of motion and solve them in terms of integrals, giving expressions for how both the radial and angular position of an object behaves in such an orbit. We are interested in the angular position which for an elliptical orbit is given by\n",

    "  t(\\theta) &= \\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi}(1-e^2)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\theta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta'}{(1+e\\cos\\theta')^2} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Here $\\tau$ is the period of the orbit, $0 \\leq e < 1$ is the eccentricity of the orbit, and I have chosen $t=0$ at periapsis (the distance of closest approach). The difficulty we encounter is not in doing the integral, that we **can** do, it is in inverting this function. We have written an equation for $t(\\theta)$ but we really want $\\theta(t)$.  One approach to inverting this would be to do what we did in the previous lab: use a root finder. That is time consuming and not amenable to taking the derivative we will need. In this lab we will instead use a spline.\n",

    "The equation given above comes from a direct solution of the equations of motion. Historically this result has been manipulated in many ways.

    "Here $\\omega t$ is called the *mean anomaly* and $\\psi$ is called the *eccentric anomaly*. (Astronomers seem to like anomalies.)

    "Though the results look very similar, there are differences. To study the magnitude of the errors in the methods we have used compute the *absolute difference* between them and produce a plot of these differences. Typically when we plot errors it makes sense to put them on a semilogarithmic plot. This can be done most easily using `semilogy` which is exactly like `plot` except that it makes the $y$-axis logarithmic. Produce a plot for the absolute differences. Again use all the good practices. (Note: Since there is only one line in the figure, is it necessary to label it and create a legend?)"
