To do so we would need to rewrite $(\\ref{eq:period1})$ so that $\\theta_m$ is not in the limits of integration. This is easy using a simple substitution. However, the integrand has a divergence at the upper limit and it seems that `quad_vec` does not handle this as well as `quad` does. The form in $(\\ref{eq:period2})$ can directly be used with `quad_vec`. In fact, the way we would naturally write the function can be used with an array of $\\theta_m$ values without any additional effort.\n",

Since we have not learned about that and since this really is not a performance critical calculation it will be acceptable to use a loop.\n",

Since `quad` can handle divergent integrands it can, and does, give us good answers to the integral in Eq. $(\\ref{eq:period1})$, so why bother doing the analytic work to transform the integral? We found above that the transformed integral $(\\ref{eq:period2})$ did lead to smaller errors, so that is a benefit. Even more so, the transformed integral requires far less work to compute. Thus by doing a small mathematical manipulation (as you have done in the homework) we arrive at a much easier and much more accurate formula for the computer to evaluate.\n",
