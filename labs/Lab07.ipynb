Here we can pass in all the relevant functions. In writing such a generic implementation, we allow for the specification of the desired convergence tolerances (absolute in `atol` and relative in `rtol`). Finally, as noted in the example from this week, whenever we have an algorithm that depends on a convergence criterion to end we must specify a maximum number of iterations to allow.

It can be perfectly valid to have a negative \"length\" as long as the angle compensates for this.\n",

To achieve this we can use the modulo operator, `%`, which works for floating point numbers as well as integers. Further, using array slicing (with boolean arrays or the `where` function), we can map any negative length to a positive length if we also change the angle by $\\pi$. In other words, for any negative $\\ell_i$ we can map it as $\\ell_i \\rightarrow -\\ell_i$ if we also map the angle $\\theta_i \\rightarrow \\theta_i-\\pi$."

    "## Alternative Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew, we have solved the problem and completed the lab. However, we may wonder if there is a better approach that would have avoided the subtleties from the beginning. The answer is yes. Here is a suggested alternative approach. You do not need to implement this yourself, but it should not be too hard to do so. In particular, you should just need to define a new function, `static_conditions_alt`, and can then reuse your `Jacobian` and `newton_raphson_iterate` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach is to just do everything in terms of vectors. When we first start using vectors in introductory physics we often complain and think they are needlessly complicated. The approach we have used in this lab seems far more natural to us.  Hopefully, as we learn more we recognize that vectors, in fact, make things significantly easier and are a much better way to approach problems. Further, they allow us to very easily generalize the problem as discussed in the previous lab. One way to represent this system is shown below.\n",

    "![Static mass-spring system with vectors.](https://github.com/cwru-phys-250/p250-spring-2023/raw/main/figures/static_springs_vectors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we allow for an arbitrary origin to our coordinate system and specify the locations of the supports as the vectors $\\vec R_j$ (we could easily have more than two) and the locations of massess as $\\vec r_j$ (again, we could easily have more than two). Our objective is to find these $\\vec r_j$ given $\\vec R_j$, and the same parameters for the springs, $\\kappa_i$, and the masses, $\\mu_j$. The red arrows in the figure represent the length vectors for the springs, $\\vec\\ell_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that now we are only solving for the positions of the masses. This means solving for four quantities, not six! We thus only need four equations, all of which come from Newton's second law. This raises some questions.\n",
    "- What happened to the extra quantities/extra conditions that were required in our original fomulation?\n",
    "- Where are the angles in this new formulation?\n",
    "- Why is this system non-linear?  The spring force is linear in the displacement after all.\n",
    "- How do we naturally avoid the issue we encountered in our solution developed over the past two labs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In answering these questions we see the power (and beauty) of using vectors!"
