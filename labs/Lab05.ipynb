    "## Baseball Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of the motion of a baseball is an interesting study in its own right. We will not undertake such a study and instead just use the results from the [Numerical Modeling of Baseball Pitching](http://people.kzoo.edu/barth/math280/articles/baseball.pdf). In fact, we will consider exactly the cases discussed in this paper. It is worth reading through the paper to appreciate how the equation of motion is approximated. For our purposes we need the result that the force on a pitched baseball is\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{m} \\vec F = - \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1.49}{1+\\exp\\left(\\frac{v-v_d}{\\Delta}\\right)} \\right] f |\n",
    "\\vec v| \\vec v + B \\vec\\omega\\times\\vec v - g \\hat z. $$\n",
    "Here we have chose the $z$-axis to be vertical, $g$ is the usual gravitational constant, $\\vec\\omega$ is the spin of the baseball, and the constants are given by $v_d=35\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\Delta=5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $f=3.9\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$, and $B=4.1\\times10^{-4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important aspect of any problem we solve is to ensure that we keep units straight. In the real world we have to deal with different sets of units used in different situations. Failing to consistently use units or to correctly convert between different sets in different parts of a calculation has lead to [catastrophic results](http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/weekly/6Page53.pdf). For an American sport and audience it sadly makes sense to specify speeds in miles per hour, distances in feet, and angular speed in revolutions per minute. Care must be taken to ensure the calculations are done in a consistent set of units (it does not matter what set) and the results presented in the commonly used ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Note*: Actually, it really would make more sense to write every thing in terms of dimensionless variables and collect all the units details into a single place. However, doing so does not alleviate the problem/danger of converting units. We would still need to convert our constants and initial conditions from whatever units they are given in, to the dimensionless variables, then convert back for showing our results. We will not do that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The main results of this lab will be plots of the trajectory of a pitched baseball. The initial conditions for the four cases we will consider are given in the table below. Note the units used in this table!\n",

    "### Function\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started we need to write a function to pass to `solve_ivp` for solving our equations of motion. We want to write a generic function that implements Newton's second law with the force given above. Note that this is a three dimensional problem. We will write a function in the form\n",
    "`baseball_func(t, y, omegavec)`\n",
    "as is appropriate for use with `solve_ivp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `t` is the current time step, `omegavec` is what we called $\\vec\\omega$ in the force above so it will be a three component array, and `y` is the array of variables representing what we are solving for in our equations of motion. Decide an order in which to store the variables in `y` and **document your choice**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to keep in mind:\n",
    "1. Choose a set of units for the calculation.\n",
    "2. There are a few constants that appear in the force. You can just define them in `baseball_func` or include them as arguments with default values.\n",
    "3. We have chosen the direction of the $z$-axis in our definition of the force (through the gravitational term, $g\\hat z$) but are otherwise writing a generic function for a generic coordinate system. This is one benefit of writing equations in terms of vectors.\n",
    "4. The force includes a term with the cross product. This can be calculated using `np.cross` if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function for the force on a baseball based on the discussion above. You will use this function with `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` to solve for the motion of a baseball. **You must document this function.** Provide a docstring and add any comments in the code such that any one looking at your function would immediately know how to use it!"

    "#### Coordinate System\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already fixed the $z$-axis to point upward, that is, opposite the direction gravity acts. We have freedom to choose the orientation of the $x$ and $y$ axes. We will choose the $x$-direction to be that in which the baseball is pitched, in other words, the direction from the pitcher's mound to home plate. This means we can write the initial velocity as\n",

    "\n",
    "The distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate on a baseball diamond is 60.5 feet.(Strictly speaking, this is the distance between the edge of the rubber closest to home plate and to the back apex of the home plate. This is not the actual distance the ball must travel as far as the batter is concerned, but is what we will use in our analysis.) Further, we will assume the baseball is released directly above the edge of the rubber along the line between the pitchers mound and home plate. In other words, we assume the baseball starts with $\\vec r(0)=0$ in the coordinate system we have defined. (Again this is not true. The actual release point depends on the pitcher and the type of pitch thrown.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to specify the initial conditions, we can solve for the motion of the baseball. In doing so we must make sure you run for a long enough time so that the baseball at least goes a little past the back of home plate, as defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the solution to the equations of motion for the following purposes. These are the required results for each of the pitches defined above.\n",
    "1. Determine the time it takes for the baseball to reach the back of home plate. Also determine its speed, $|\\vec v|$, at this time.\n",
    "2. Produce a figure showing the horizontal, $y$, and vertical, $z$, displacements of the baseball as a function of its distance from the pitcher's mound, $x$. This figure should show the curves up to, and a little past, home plate. In the figure include a horizontal line at zero displacement and a vertical line at home plate. The figure you produce should contain the same curves as found in the paper referenced above. You should look at those figures to verify your calculations are correct. You should also look at them to see how to *not* produce figures. Okay, they are not *unreadable*, but they do leave much to be desired. You can produce much nicer looking figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we proceed? The way I recommend is to start with one pitch, it does not matter which one, and do the steps by hand to get the desired results. Once you understand these results, you can write a function that, given the initial conditions for a pitch, does these steps for you and produces the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing this **do not delete the cells below.** Further **use the cells below for your final function definitions.**  The reason for this is that any cell with your answers in it contains metadata used during the grading process. This metadata makes grading much, much easier. Without it I need to do much more work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you can do many things. One is to create scratch cells, do work in them, and delete those after you have moved the relevant information into the function you will define below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how you proceed, you want to analyze the pitches to determine the results requested above. There are a few decisions you will have to make when doing this.\n",
    "1. How do we determine how long to integrate the differential equation for? We can make an estimate, and that is sufficient. Alternatively, this is another opportunity to use the `events` keyword in `solve_ivp`.\n",
    "2. How do we get an accurate estimate of the time it takes to reach the back of home plate and the speed at this time? Just using the `where` function is **not sufficient**. How can we do better? (There are a number of ways.)\n",
    "3. How should we present the results? Here again we need to keep in mind units. We can work in whatever units we want, but the input and output should be in (American) readable units.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should consider what you think would be the best way to organize the calculation. To help you along, we will break up the problem into two steps. First, define a function that calculates the trajectory of the baseball. This function should take as input the initial conditions in standard (American) units, convert the units if necessary, solve the differential equation for the trajectory of the baseball, convert the result back to American units (if necessary), and return arrays containing the position and velocity of the baseball along with an array for the times at which the position and velocity were evaluated. Make sure you clearly document your function!"
