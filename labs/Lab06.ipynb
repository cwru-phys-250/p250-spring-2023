    "## Static Mass-Spring Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two labs we will write code that will allow us to determine the static configuration for a mass-spring system of the type shown below.  To do so we will iteratively use the Newton-Raphson method to solve a system of non-linear equations.  Before we can do that, we first need to set up the problem. The set up is the main purpose of this lab!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Static spring configuration](https://github.com/cwru-phys-250/p250-spring-2023/raw/main/figures/static_springs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows a conventional way to represent a system of two masses and three springs. The choices of angles, labels for the springs, *etc.* may not be the easiest for a numerical implementation, but it is familiar to us from an introductory physics course. Thus, our numerical solution must take inputs consistent with this figure and must also produce outputs consistent with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code we can choose to define things differently and map between the choices made in the figure and choices that we find more convenient. This is always an issue when solving a problem, particularly numerically. Though there may be a more convenient way to represent the information in our code, changing from the convention shown in the figure comes at a cost. Ultimately we want our code to be understandable. We want other people to be able to read it and we also want to be able to modify it ourselves, particularly if we come back months or years later. We do not want to have to work hard to understand some different convention chosen at the moment when we were writing the code but now does not make sense to us! Regardless of what choices we make, they must be clearly documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this system we first need to know exactly what problem we want to solve.  Vaguely it is to determine the static configuration. It is worth thinking about what that means for yourself. For the lab we will clearly specify the system along with what input will be given and what output is to be produced. You will be \"guided\" on how to think about and set up this problem. That does not mean this will be the best approach.  This will be revisited at the end of the next lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a problem we should try to be as general as possible. Rarely are we really interesting in the exact problem given, instead we are interested in a class of problems and would like to be able to solve any in that class. In this case we could imagine many generalizations to the system shown in the figure. We could allow for many changes.\n",
    "1. Arbitrary number of masses.\n",
    "2. Arbitrary number of connecting springs to each mass.\n",
    "3. Arbitrary number of support points.\n",
    "4. Three dimensional configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should include generalizations in our code if they do not make the solution significantly more complicated. For this lab you do not need to include such generalizations, but you should think about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem will be: given two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, connected by three springs with spring constants $k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$ and natural lengths $\\ell_{0,1}$, $\\ell_{0,2}$, and $\\ell_{0,3}$ at two support points separated by a distance $d$, determine the lengths $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$, and $\\ell_3$ of the springs, along with the angles $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, and $\\theta_3$, in the static configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, before proceeding we can do more than that. As is almost always the case we need to worry about units. Yet units should not matter. In fact, in the problem given does it matter if the distance between the support points is 1 cm, 1 meter, 1 mile, *etc.*? No! In general it is always best to work in terms of dimensionless quantities, that is, quantities that are relative to each other. In this case we really do not care what $d$ is, all we really care about is how all the lengths in this system compare to $d$. This means we can think of measuring all lengths in units of $d$, or equivalently that we will specify the natural lengths as the ratio $\\ell_{0,i}/d$ and find the ratio of lengths $\\ell_i/d$ as our solution. Effectively this means that we can \"just set\" $d=1$ and when we say, for example, that $\\ell_{0,1}=1.5$ we mean that $\\ell_{0,1}=1.5 d$. Similarly it is convenient to specify the masses in terms of some mass unit, it really does not matter what it is. Let us call this mass $M$. We will thus always specify things as a ratio of masses. To make this more clear let us define $\\mu_j \\equiv m_j/M$. Finally, instead of specifying the spring constants in some units we can normalize them with this mass scale too by defining $\\kappa_i \\equiv \\frac{k_i d}{M g}$, where $g$ is the gravitational constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new statement of our problem is as follows. Given two normalize masses, $\\mu_j$, and three springs with normalized spring constants, $\\kappa_i$, and natural lengths, $\\ell_{0,i}$ in units of $d$, determine in the static configuration the lengths of the springs, $\\ell_i$ in units of $d$ along with the angles $\\theta_i$."

It may seem odd to do this, after all we *know* that the final support must be at `(1,0)`, so why calculate this? By calculating it this does a couple of things.
